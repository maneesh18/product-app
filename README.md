This is an Angular application that displays a list of products and allows viewing product details.

Step 1: clone the code from the given repository to your local folder

Step 2: Make sure you have Node.js installed

Step 3: Use cd to move to that folder in your terminal,
add angular package to your system to run the application,
Run `npm install` to install dependencies

step 4: Run `ng serve` to start the development server

step 5: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

Refactorings that can be done:

1. We can implement pagination if we have more products.
2. add trackby to efficiently track list changes.
3. Can add Error handling for data Fetching. (As it is a Hard coded data we don't need that)
4. Also added `products.json` if we want to keep those products in a separate file for readability.
